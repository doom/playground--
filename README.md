# playground--
Messy C++ playground, it had to be backed up somewhere

- lazy: lazy-ish values
- bind: implementation of std::bind in C++98 (guided school exercise)
- delta_ptr: implementation of "Delta Pointers" (automatic bound-checking pointers)
- inplace_any: non-allocating version of std::any
- constexpr_map: constexpr map/set implementation
- struct_utils: utilities to manipulate aggregates (unpack them as tuples, print them, ...)
- function_view: function_view is to a function what string_view is to a string
